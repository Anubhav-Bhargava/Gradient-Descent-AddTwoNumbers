This is the Python implementation of the Gradeint Descent algorithm.
Here it is used to train the neural network to add two numbers.
It is based on the Andrew NG's coursera course, Intro to Machine Learning.

Dependencies:-
Numpy

Execution:-
To run the example, simply run Gradient-Descent.py file using Python.
python Gradient-Descent.py

The output will look like this:-

Initial value of weights
[ 0.4359949   0.02592623]
Final value of weights
[ 0.99999967  1.00000016]
Addition of 34 and 6 is equal to
[ 39.99998982]
